Earthquake Prediction Using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
Earthquake prediction is a challenging yet crucial task that can help in disaster preparedness and risk mitigation. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze seismic data and predict earthquake occurrences with improved accuracy.

🛠 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction from seismic datasets
- Machine learning models for earthquake prediction
- Evaluation and performance metrics analysis
- Visualization of seismic activity patterns
- Deployment-ready model for real-time predictions

🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset**: Public seismic datasets (e.g., USGS Earthquake Catalog) 
- **Deployment**: Flask/FastAPI (optional for real-time prediction)

I used threads for optimal usage of resources. I have embedded the satellite data from USGS open database for realtime prediciton. I have used batch processing using threads to call the satellite data and embedded it with the normal database. 
Python is the main language that is used in the machine learning model.


📊 Results & Analysis
- The trained model achieves an accuracy of **X%** (update after training)
- Feature importance analysis and visualization of seismic trends
- Comparison of different machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, etc.)

📌 Future Improvements
- Enhance data preprocessing techniques
- Incorporate deep learning for better accuracy
- Deploy as a web application for real-time monitoring
